Bouncing-Speaker
================

CSS3 animation, JQuery 

We are using CSS3 and JQuery to animate images. In this example based on the state of the element the speaker image supports different actions:
* the speaker bounces every 6 seconds vertically
* on mouse over we added a swing animation
* if the speaker is clicked it will flip and also a short audio will start playing
